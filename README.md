# Principles-of-Programming-Languages-and-Translators
Translation and compilation of programming languages

The project is a programming language grammar and an implementation of it using compiler construction tools, specifically Flex (for lexical analysis) and Bison (for syntax analysis). It presents the BNF (Backus-Naur Form) grammar definitions for a custom programming language, covering its structure and key syntactic elements such as PROGRAM, FUNCTION, STARTMAIN, variable declarations, control flow structures (if, switch, while, for), print, break, and struct. The report outlines how different language constructs are defined and parsed, provides example input programs, and discusses how the syntax is applied and recognized by the lexer and parser. Additionally, it touches on multi-line comments and user-defined types (like struct), and mentions features that are not yet implemented, such as variable declaration checking. Overall, the report documents the grammar design, language constructs, and corresponding implementations for a simple custom language used for educational or compiler design purposes.
